// for ci / cd - as soon as code has been pushed to repo
create folder called .github\workflow
create a yaml file inside this folder called main.yaml - already templates are available. This defines workflow
when there is a commit the git will always check for worksflow file and then the github will execute the yaml file 
like it will build he docker image, creat the container, push it to the heroku and start the server
